These crops include:
* Any soil based crop (Wheat, carrots, etc.)
* Bamboo
* Saplings
* Sugar Cane
* Sweet Berries

## Configuration
_Updated as of 1.5.0_

To configure the speed at which crops grow there are two options:
1. Use [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) to configure the settings in game with a gui.
2. Go into the config file and change the settings.
