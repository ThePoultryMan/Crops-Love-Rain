## About

Crops Love Rain makes crops grow faster when it's raining.

## Configuration
_Updated as of 1.5.0_

To configure the speed at which crops grow there are two options:
1. Use [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) to configure the settings in game with a gui.
2. Go into the config file and change the settings.

 _Note: Version 1.4.0 and below are no longer supported._
